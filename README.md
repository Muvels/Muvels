I Like Web Development, especially the creation of application programming interfaces and the programming of backend programmes. <br><br>
Have fun on my Github Page :D

## My Current Projects
+   Tensorflow Image Detection on Boxes of PDFs in order to perform Key Value      Analysis on that Boxes.
+   User Interface for Tensorflow Model Training, so you can train your Models from everywhere
